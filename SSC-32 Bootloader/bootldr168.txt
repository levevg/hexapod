When programming into the SSC-32 (14.7456 MHz ATMega168), use the
following fuse bit and lock bit settings.  (0=programmed,
1=unprogrammed)

Fuse Low Byte:

SUT0 = 1       Crystal Oscillator, slowly rising power
SUT1 = 1
CKSEL0 = 1

CKSEL1 = 1     Full swing external Crystal/Ceramic Resonator
CKSEL2 = 1
CKSEL3 = 0

CKDIV8 = 1     Clock source NOT divided by 8
CKOUT  = 1     Clock NOT output on PORTB0

Fuse High Byte:

BODLEVEL0 = 0  Brown-out reset enabled at 4.3V
BODLEVEL1 = 0
BODLEVEL2 = 1

EESAVE =1      EEPROM is not reserved during chip erase

WDTON = 1      Watchdog timer is OFF

SPIEN = 0      serial programming enabled
               (Fuse-bit unaccessible during serial programming)

DWEN = 1       Debug wire disabled

RSTDISBL = 1   External reset enabled

Extended Fuse Byte:

BOOTRST = 0    Go to boot-section after reset
BOOTSZ0 = 1    128-word boot section (256 bytes)
BOOTSZ1 = 1

Lock Byte:

BLB12 = 0     SPM/LPM not allowed to read/write boot section, at the same time
BLB11 = 0     this disables interrupts during boot-loader execution

BLB02 = 1     No SPM/LPM restrictions on App section
BLB01 = 1

LB2 = 1       No memory lock (otherwise the boot-loader is useless)
LB1 = 1
